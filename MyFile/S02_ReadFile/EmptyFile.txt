Creates a FileInputStream by opening a connection to an actual file, the file named by the path name name in the file system. 
A new FileDescriptor object is created to represent this file connection.
First, if there is a security manager, its checkRead method is called with the name argument as its argument.
If the named file does not exist, is a directory rather than a regular file, 
or for some other reason cannot be opened for reading then a FileNotFoundException is thrown.
